My name is Erik S. I live near Spokane, Washington and recently completed the Visual Comm Design BDes + UX/Web Training Certificate program at Eastern Washington University (class of '21). This web site template was my first out the gate after graduation. Since then, I've maintained proficiency w/the tools, completed successful freelance projects, and now working up those + as many portfolio-ready projects as I can while balancing time w/projects at our rural home-front, homeschooling our daughter, networking and spending time w/friends, colleagues & family.

Soon, this URL will re-direct to a new site I have been developing for some time now that will more accurately host & reflect my style, personality and works. Please come back in >>> December '21...
