> *This is where I can share my guitar influences and how it inspires my work. Furthermore, how I think that every UX/UI designer should pick up this instrument in order to fully appreciate and learn hands-on how you too as a designer can create similar user experience + interactions by following the essential principles and practices of modern UX & UI design that are manifest + inherent in the design of guitars*

The posters above were from a portfolio class, Spring 2020. Because I used a lot of hi-res metallic vector graphics + tons of shadowing + filter FX in order to make them look more real, the .ai files were really BIG!

###### ***BONUS: I learned a ton about high detail rendering techniques and how to get the most out of textures, patterns and FX w/the tools***

##### ðŸŽ¸ ***The first was a redesign of the 1968 Fender***Â® ***Jaguar***

##### **ðŸŽ¸ *Next, was a re-imagined >> future version of the '68 Jaguar collaboration w/old guitarist friend that resulted in the more chiseled & minimal "Jagger" design in the posters***

##### ðŸŽ¸ ***Followed by iconic Gibson***Â® ***Flying V & Les Paul models I love doing + have many more in works (Strats, Teles, etc..)***

Hereâ€™s some screenshots from those projects where I typically used Adobe Illustrator to design every detail, layer by layer so every element of the guitars were customizable stylistically:

Here's an example of how I *layer the guitar components* ***+ give every single piece a specific function-title*** before exporting from assets in Adobe Illustrator to Figma for further customizing/project integration *and* ***so it's easier to customize the guitars at the highest detail***  when you export as assets from Adobe Illustrator to a prototyping tool like Figma:

Here's a few examples from my Figma experiments w/these Guitar Design Templates I created to be fully customizable svg/eps files:
