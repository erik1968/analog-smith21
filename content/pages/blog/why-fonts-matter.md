###### *This is where I can share my guitar influences and how it inspires my work. Furthermore, how I think that every UX/UI designer should pick up this instrument in order to fully appreciate and learn hands-on how you too as a designer can create similar user experience + interactions by following the essential principles and practices of modern UX & UI design.*

I've played guitars for most of my life and honestly it never gets old as long as you keep it fresh & learn new songs, riffs, chords, scales, etc.. And, with zillions of guitar instructions, tuts & lessons available >> most for free! >> on video sharing platforms like Youtube, there's no reason a guitarist should ever get "bored."

So, that's the "playing"/user experience element of the craft, but what about actually designing guitars? Well, a few opportunities did come up during my time in the design program at EWU. 

The posters above were from a portfolio class, Spring 2020. Because I used a lot of hi-resolution metallic vector graphics + a lot of shadowing, and filter FX in order to make them look more real, the .ai files were HUGE!!! But, it was worth the extra efforts as I learned a ton about high detail rendering techniques and how to get the most out of textures, patterns and FX w/the tools.

*   The first was a redesign of the iconic Gibson Flying “V”, then a Gibson Les Paul replica

*   Followed by a Fender Jaguar

*   And finally my 1st guitar design from scratch that is a re-imagined, future version of the old classic Fender Jaguar.

Here’s some screenshots from those projects where I typically used Adobe Illustrator to design every detail, layer by layer so every element of the guitars were customizable stylistically:

Here's some examples of how I layer the guitar components so they're easier to customize when you export as assets from Adobe Illustrator to a prototyping tool like Figma:
