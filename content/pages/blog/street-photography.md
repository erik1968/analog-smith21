A little bit about this interesting photograph I found & purchased (123rf) titled, "Cityscape of St, Petersburg, the Bridge and the Sphinx" \[[copyright/credit: kosmos111, Russian Federation](https://www.123rf.com/profile_kosmos111)]. Russia has a long long history, rich with amazing stories, events >> resilient diverse cultures who endured all kinds of challenges, always adapting and perservering throughout the centuries. Well, I love reading books, and especially enjoy learning about interesting places like Russia. In fact, I had done some research about Russia in 2017 into a sort of "lost" period of time when Europeans were   calling the peoples that lived where Russia is now "Tartars" and they referred to that region as "Tartaria" or "Great Tartary." There's interesting maps you can easily search & find what I'm talking about. Here's what an encyclopia said about it:  or  I decided to research + explore it visually in the context of an exercise created by designer Chip Kidd that helps us comprehend the core essentials of good design.

So, this project is really just pushing the limits of what I could imagine compared to the most simple and reduced version of itself >>> if that makes an sense? If not, it's ok, because this was the most openly estoteric (is that possible?) expression of what I could create related to each of the principles of design for this exercise.

> **I don't know why, but I absolutely love how these turned out in there simple forms and places. It's a deep deep dive for me.. Maybe you too..**
