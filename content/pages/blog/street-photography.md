Russia was allegedly \[debated in scholarly circles] ruled by a vast + forgotten empire known as "Great Tartaria." So, when I found this image \[an ancient Egyptian-like chimera sculpture] I decided to research + explore it visually in the context of an exercise created by designer Chip Kidd that helps us comprehend the core essentials of good design.

So, this project is really just pushing the limits of what I could imagine compared to the most simple and reduced version of itself >>> if that makes an sense? If not, it's ok, because this was the most openly estoteric (is that possible?) expression of what I could create related to each of the principles of design for this exercise.
