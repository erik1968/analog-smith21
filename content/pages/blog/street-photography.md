A little bit about this interesting photograph I found & purchased (123rf) titled, "Cityscape of St, Petersburg, the Bridge and the Sphinx" \[[copyright/credit: kosmos111, Russian Federation](https://www.123rf.com/profile_kosmos111)]. Russia has a long long history, rich with amazing stories, events >> resilient diverse cultures who endured all kinds of challenges, always adapting and perservering throughout the centuries. Well, I love reading *real* books and doing deep-dives into our mysterious past on Earth because there's a lot that we just do not know \[ remember history is written by the victors >> still need to find this quote to cite here! ] or we only have fragments, myths, tales and folklore. So, when I found this photo of a sphinx-chimera-like figure perched on an old bridge in St. Petersburg, I just knew I had to buy it! That's because I had done some research about Russia in 2017. I was looking into a sort of "lost" period of time when Europeans called the people that lived where Russia is now "Tartars." And, they referred to that region as "Tartaria" or "Great Tartary." There's interesting maps you can easily search & find what I'm talking about.

Here's what an encyclopia said about it:

> *Tartary, a vast country in the northern parts of Asia, bounded by Siberia on the north and west: this is called Great Tartary. The Tartars who lie south of Muscovy and Siberia, are those of Astraca, Circassia, and Dagistan, situated north-west of the Caspian-sea; the Calmuc Tartars, who lie between Siberia and the Caspian-sea; the Usbeck Tartars and Moguls, who lie north of Persia and India; and lastly, those of Tibet, who lie north-west of China." \[Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. III, Edinburgh, 1771, p. 887].  I decided to research + explore it visually in the context of an exercise created by designer Chip Kidd that helps us comprehend the core essentials of good design.*

Well, at the time I bought it, I had an assignment Visual Comm Design I was stuck in >> basically, our professor created a project centered around an exercise about "form" based on designer Chip Kidd's "Go Exercises" \[ source/citation here! ]. So, she asked to find a single photograph and use it repeatedly in 18 or 19 compositions where each sheet/page was an abstraction of one of the core principles of graphic design, e.g., scale, inversion, focus, juxtaposition, image quality, color theory, etc... And, the rules were basically to make it as minimal / reductive / abstract as possible >> just enough marks that the principle depicted is self-explanatory/instantly recognizable. Yeah, like a logo.

So what? Well, the reason I was stuck on that assignment is because I couldn't find an image that generated the kind of abstract thinking required to do this project correctly. I needed something profound in nature. And, for me, this photo was perfect! It was the combination of that research I talked about earlier/above and this photo that gave me the inspiration to push the limits of what I could imagine for each core principle >>> which are all the compositions on this page. I still look at these from time to time when I am working on something that is abstract.
