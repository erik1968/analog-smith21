A little bit about this interesting photograph I found & purchased (123rf) titled, "Cityscape of St, Petersburg, the Bridge and the Sphinx" \[[copyright/credit: kosmos111, Russian Federation](https://www.123rf.com/profile_kosmos111)]. Russia has a long long history, rich with amazing stories, events >> resilient diverse cultures who endured all kinds of challenges, always adapting and perservering throughout the centuries. Well, I love reading *real* books and doing deep-dives into our mysterious past on Earth because there's a lot that we just do not know \[ remember history is written by the victors >> still need to find this quote to cite here! ] or we only have fragments, myths, tales and folklore. So, when I found this photo of a sphinx-chimera-like figure perched on an old bridge in St. Petersburg, I just knew I had to buy it! That's because I had done some research about Russia in 2017. I was looking into a sort of "lost" period of time when Europeans were called the people that lived where Russia is now "Tartars." And, they referred to that region as "Tartaria" or "Great Tartary." There's interesting maps you can easily search & find what I'm talking about.

Here's what an encyclopia said about it:

> *Tartary, a vast country in the northern parts of Asia, bounded by Siberia on the north and west: this is called Great Tartary. The Tartars who lie south of Muscovy and Siberia, are those of Astraca, Circassia, and Dagistan, situated north-west of the Caspian-sea; the Calmuc Tartars, who lie between Siberia and the Caspian-sea; the Usbeck Tartars and Moguls, who lie north of Persia and India; and lastly, those of Tibet, who lie north-west of China." \[Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. III, Edinburgh, 1771, p. 887].  I decided to research + explore it visually in the context of an exercise created by designer Chip Kidd that helps us comprehend the core essentials of good design.*

So, this project is really just pushing the limits of what I could imagine compared to the most simple and reduced version of itself >>> if that makes an sense? If not, it's ok, because this was the most openly estoteric (is that possible?) expression of what I could create related to each of the principles of design for this exercise.

> **I don't know why, but I absolutely love how these turned out in there simple forms and places. It's a deep deep dive for me.. Maybe you too..**
