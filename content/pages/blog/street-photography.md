Well, at the time I bought it, I had an assignment Visual Comm Design I was stuck in >> basically, our professor created a project centered around an exercise about "form" based on designer Chip Kidd's "Go Exercises" \[ source/citation here! ]. So, she asked to find a single photograph and use it repeatedly in 18 or 19 compositions where each sheet/page was an abstraction of one of the core principles of graphic design, e.g., scale, inversion, focus, juxtaposition, image quality, color theory, etc... And, the rules were basically to make it as minimal / reductive / abstract as possible >> just enough marks that the principle depicted is self-explanatory/instantly recognizable. Yeah, like a logo.

So what? Well, the reason I was stuck on that assignment is because I couldn't find an image that generated the kind of abstract thinking required to do this project correctly. I needed something profound in nature. And, for me, this photo was perfect! It was the combination of that research I talked about earlier/above and this photo that gave me the inspiration to push the limits of what I could imagine for each core principle >>> which are all the compositions on this page. I still look at these from time to time when I am working on something that is abstract.
