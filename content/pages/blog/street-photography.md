This was a project early-on in my training in EWU‚Äôs Visual Communication Design program (c. winter 2019), so I was still getting used to all the digital design tools.

> *For some reason I really like how these compositions turned out >> but, honestly I don't understand why as I am not that abstract or minimal...*

Basically, this project was an exploration into the core concepts of design related to ***‚Äúhow things look,‚Äù aka: FORM*** *\[ >>> Huge KUDOS to Prof Ginelle Hustrulid + the text ‚ÄúGO A Kidd‚Äôs Guide to Graphic Design, by Chip Kidd‚Äù ].*

No, seriously, this was a really challenging project that ***forced me to think at the most elementary levels of perception, perspective and contextual learning.*** And, reminds me of some of the essential Bauhaus (Germany) exposure and training we also received early in the program.

And, of course ***it all makes a lot more sense later in the game*** once you‚Äôve had a chance to learn and practice more. In retrospect, ***I can clearly see why*** our teachers chose these projects and exercises. ***It‚Äôs very effective and I hope you can agree after you gone down this rabbit hole with me.***
