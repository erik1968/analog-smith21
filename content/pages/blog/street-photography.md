*\[ Bauhaus inspired posters from History of Design, Fall 2018 ]*

> The poster above was originally plain, old construction paper >> 11x17". So, why not have some fun with it and “digitize” it as I absolutely love to do!

So, I digitized it!! And, at the same time >> I did not! [ please bear with me >> it will make sense after I explain ]
