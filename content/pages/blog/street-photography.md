This was a project early-on in my training in EWU’s Visual Communication Design program (c. winter 2019), so I was still getting used to all the digital design tools. Nevertheless, I really liked how these compositions turned out! 

Basically, this project was an exploration into the core concepts of design related to ***“how things look,” aka: FORM*** \[ Credits/Cite this to Prof “GH” + “GO A Kidd’s Guide to Graphic Design, by Chip Kidd” ].

No, seriously, this was a really challenging project that forced me to think at the most elementary levels of perception, perspective and contextual learning. And, reminds me of some of the elementary/essential Bauhaus (Germany) exposure and training we also received early in the program.

And, of course it all makes a lot more sense later in the game once you’ve had a chance to learn + practice more. Now, in retrospect, I can see + respect why our teachers chose these projects and exercises. It’s very effective and I hope you can agree after you gone down this rabbit hole with me.
