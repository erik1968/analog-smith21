*\[ Bauhaus inspired posters from History of Design, Fall 2018 ]*

The poster above was originally totally analog >>> sketched, ruled, squared & then cut-out in construction paper in layered sheets over an 11"x17" sheet background sheet

> *But, it got a lot funner when I had the chance to "digitize" it... Or, not? Yeah, so, I digitized it with the full intention of making it look as real / analog as possible because I absolutely love doing stuff like this.*

And, It's good practice, you get to explore so many different options in terms of the look + feel >> different surface textures and more..No matter if anyone likes it:: for me, it's great practice!
