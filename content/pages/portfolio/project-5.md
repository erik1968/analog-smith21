Although the bulk of my college training is in Visual Comm Design \[BDes], I was keenly aware of the fact that our world is more interconnected via the web than ever. So I knew I'd better sign-up for a good chunk of Web & UX/UI training if I ever want to reach my work's target audience(s), or even discover--for that matter--a fair number of potential colleagues, collaborators and clients. Because doing traditional design work as a "stand alone designer" \[whether it's illustration, posters, flyers, logos, branding, photographic and print/publishing work] **without** a good handle on how to translate, design and publish (develop) that work on web platforms is just not feasible, nor a competitive strategy in my opinion.

> Design, don't decorate" - ? Who said it first ?

So, in Web 1 training, we began with a combo of code-only developing on one training stream, and a "visual"/GUI-based method. For GUI we used[ **Webflow**](https://webflow.com/)** **\[ref: cover image above from[** my first site using their CMS here**](https://analogsmith-xyz-dffb39.webflow.io/)**]. **Coming from an IT background (USAF Cyber Systems), there was a GUI for everything so that was fine, \*but I appreciated the \*\*power + flexibility of coding \**early-on* and made sure to stay on top of that throughout the certfication training at EWU.

My first 'coded' work was for a[ **movie trailer cover**](https://erik1968.github.io/movie-trailer/), then a more animated attempt at a[ **Google Doodle**](https://erik1968.github.io/google-doodle/). I has happy with the movie trailer, but not so much with the Google Doodle as I wanted to use javascript to do a lot more with it, but was not there training/proficiency-wise yet \[there will be a part 2].
