**Deliverables ::**

Interactive digital conversion prototype of the existing reference analog toaster-convection oven, including:

*   Standardized & interactive digital control panel for further development \[ Component: “Control Panel Template” ]

*   Product Mock-Up, including the Control Panel Template

*   A functional digital rendering of the original toaster oven design that includes all the original functions + new options, e.g., “Pizza”...

> ##### **"Design, don't decorate" -who said this first?**

#### **Project Objective ::**

As this was an early project in my UX training, I wanted to take a totally analog appliance through the redesign steps required to conceptually and visually transform its user-interface, i.e., operating buttons and dials, into a digital appliance interface.
