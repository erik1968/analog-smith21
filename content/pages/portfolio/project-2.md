title: 'Project II > Board Game Redesign [ Triominos® ]'
subtitle: >-
  This was the perfect UX design project to take all the way to the finish line
  so to speak >> tested and challenged pretty much everything I had learned in
  college and more, like going from:: flat, 2D packaging dielines to its digital
  3D scale equivalents in Adobe Illustrator, then replicate it all to scale with
  a real folding, magnetic game board+case >> Thanks in good part to a
  conceptually similar design in production by ChessArmory.com® > thank you! >
  because, it was ChessArmory's® overall game board design that allowed me to
  explore my goal and custom design the magnetic game pieces/tiles, design and
  print a new surface graphic pattern, and more >> like practice product
  photography and image processing >> and, then practice dieline+surface
  graphics print production.. I am so glad I had a project I could explore so
  many different aspects >> including sub-specialties > that meaning >> within
  the spheres of UX & UI Design.

Improved Game Instructions, and a funner, more engaged game playing experience with a redesigned 'gaming platform' + new game pieces and a game playing surface for all situations, at home, on the road, whatever >> this deliverable must be a 3D tested solution...

> This project allowed me to push the limits of what I'd been taught about UX, Web and Visual design...

### **Project Goals & Summary ::**

The goal the from beginning was to improve the instructions and game playing experience. After discovery and some good research I initially went with an ***anniversary special edition*** with very similar graphics, type treatment and all to the original game release by PressmanToy® in 1968 \[see Triominos® Box versions photos archive near bottom of this page & in the Figma project links].

#### [**Versions 1 & 2 Below:  ▶️**](https://www.figma.com/file/YwHjBNuJeNuP3hJuCEBPMD/UX2-P1-V1-V2-Board-Game-TriOminos-Redesign?node-id=1%3A68)

So, the triangle shaped game packaging as of 2017 was retained, except for the background color -- black to red. And, the instructions were revised significantly with extra emphasis on type weight, size and contrast to make them easier to read, especially at smaller type sizes.

> *But, when it came time to create a 3D mockup a potential problem had to to be solved: how to handle the potential cost of producing the new hexagon shaped instructions + half-a-dozen triangular magnetic game “board” sheets? If I kept the orignal size scale, the magnets alone could kill this project*

**I remember thinking: why didn’t I catch this?!** Well, I know the reason and I will make that confession at the end/lessons learned slide. At any rate, I looked at my options and decided to do the right thing: Keep it Simple(ler), i.e, the simplest solution is often the best (note to self!). So, I changed the instructions, game board and tiles/pieces to a more compact, portable and player-friendly design in unsteady, bumpy situations like turbulence on a long flight, or a windy day at the park.[﻿﻿](https://www.figma.com/file/YwHjBNuJeNuP3hJuCEBPMD/UX2-P1-V1-V2-Board-Game-TriOminos-Redesign?node-id=0%3A1)
