      ###### *Hello, I'm currently developing a new site to host my portfolio,
      other works and a blog. So, this site hosts some of my favorite UX design
      projects from school. The new site will host a more robust portfolio with
      a greater variety of works, e.g., graphics and branding type work,
      typographic, UX/UI, web design, photographic, package and production
      design works.*


      ###### *When it's ready, this site will re-direct to the new site.*
